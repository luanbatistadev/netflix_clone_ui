## <p align='center'>Web Version with Flutter!</p>
- ### This web version uses flutter. It has one more implementation than the version that runs on mobile! It has a video player that plays the video when the page is launched in the browser. This feature mirrors what exists on the original netflix website!

## <p align='center'>Mobile Version: Android | IOS</p>

- ### The mobile version doesn't have a video player yet, as it wasn't possible to add it yet! But it's still a nice, well-organized design!
